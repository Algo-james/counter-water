💧 Counter Water Project
A smart and simple solution to monitor and track water usage in real time. Ideal for homes, farms, schools, or any place where water conservation and usage awareness are critical.

🚀 Overview
The Counter Water Project helps users:

Track water consumption using a flow sensor or manual input.

Monitor daily, weekly, and monthly usage.

Get alerts for unusual usage patterns.

Promote water conservation through data-driven decisions.

📦 Features
⏱️ Real-time water usage tracking

📊 Historical data logging and visualization

🔔 Custom usage alerts

🌐 Optional web/mobile dashboard

🛠️ Easy setup and calibration

🧰 Tech Stack (example)
Hardware: Flow Sensor (YF-S201), Arduino/Raspberry Pi

Backend: Python / Node.js / Firebase

Frontend: React / Vue / HTML+JS

Data Storage: SQLite / Firebase / SD Card

Note: Tech stack can vary based on your setup or preferred tools.

🛠️ Setup
Hardware
Connect the flow sensor to your microcontroller.

Use an interrupt pin to count pulses (each pulse = fixed amount of water).

Power the system with 5V regulated supply.

Software
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/counter-water-project.git
Upload the code to your microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or similar.

(Optional) Launch the dashboard:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd dashboard
npm install
npm start
⚙️ Configuration
Update the config.h or .env file with:

Flow rate calibration value (e.g., 7.5 pulses/liter)

Alert thresholds

WiFi credentials (if using a connected device)
